This program was created to display the letters of the alphabet starting from only one letter and then going to 
the next line and adding one more letter. For example:
A
AB
ABC

You are able to choose how many rows will be made, so you get to decide till what letter you want the "graph" to go.
So if you pick the number 23, there will only be 23 rows and the last letter in the 23'rd row will be W.
We have also implemented an option for you to choose between UPPERCASE letters or lowercase letters to be displayed.
